SOCIS Website
==================
http://socis.ca

This is a student built and maintained website. If you feel like joining in on the construction, feel free on cloning this repository and submitting some changes. Code is reviewed by the SOCIS exec before it becomes live, so for new students, this could be your first experience with code review!

__1. Clone the Repo__

Most people can probably figure this one out, but I'll leave it here to be safe.
Run `git clone https://github.com/UoGSOCIS/uogsocis.github.io` somewhere locally on your computer to pull the site code from git.
`cd uogsocis.github.io` to navigate into the newly created folder for the repo.

__2. Install Jekyll__

http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/
No need to reiterate the Jekyll docs, this is the part which will take a while to install. You're going to need Ruby, Rubygems and NodeJS.
Once you have those all installed run `gem install jekyll` to get Jekyll installed locally.

__3. Start the web server__
To start the local server, all you need to do is run `jekyll serve` from the website's root directory.
If you open up your browser and navigate to `localhost:4000`, you should now be able to see the site running locally.

_Note that after making any local changes, you will need to restart the Jekyll server._


That's all folks!
