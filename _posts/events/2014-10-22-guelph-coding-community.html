        GCC Tech Talks are events designed to showcase what your fellow students in SOCS are doing and maybe to even share some knowledge. Check the site regularly for more updates on who will be speaking and what content will be covered.

      <p>As always there will be plenty of time for socializing after the talks as well. Hope to see everyone there!</p>
