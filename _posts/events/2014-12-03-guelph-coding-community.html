        GCC Tech Talks are events designed to showcase what your fellow students in SOCS are doing and maybe to even share some knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stayed tuned for updates on who will be speaking and the topics that will be covered during this final GCC of the semester.
      </p>

        As always there will be plenty of time for socializing after the talks as well. Hope to see everyone there!
