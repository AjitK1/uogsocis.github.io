        GCC Tech Talks are events designed to showcase what your fellow students in SoCS are doing and maybe to even share some knowledge. We've got three awesome talks lined up:
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Marshall Asch will be doing a talk on Mobile Mesh Networks.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Ryan Taylor is presenting his work on Analyzing Student Mental Health Based On Homework Using Text Clustering.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Jacob Knarr will be talking about Fragments and Dialogs in Android Development.</p>
      <br>
      <p>As always there will be plenty of time for socializing after the talks as well. Hope to see everyone there!</p>
