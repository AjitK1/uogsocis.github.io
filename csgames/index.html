          CS Games is an annual programming competition. It is held this year at Sherbrooke University
          in Quebec. It is an exciting opportunity for undergraduate students to demonstrate their
          programming skills in representation of Guelph!
          <br><br>
          The event is open to all University of Guelph undergraduate students in Computer Science &
          Software Engineering. In the past, registration & hotel cost has been covered by the SOCS
          department, transportation is the only cost involved.
