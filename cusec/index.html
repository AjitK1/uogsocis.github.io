          <a href="http://2015.cusec.net/" target="_blank">CUSEC</a> is an annual conference that takes place in
          Montreal in January. Over 400 students interested in
          Software Engineering and Computer Science attend each year. CUSEC aims to expose students to new technologies,
          to excite them about software development, and to provide opportunities for connecting with peers
          and potential employers.

          Unfortunately we are already at our max capacity for students we can send to the conference for 2015. Tickets
          have already sold out and we are unable to accommodate for additional students at this point.
