        </p>
        <p>
          The University of Guelph would like to invite you to Roboticon 2015. This year's robot-building and programming challenge will be occurring on Saturday, March 21<sup>st</sup> &amp; Sunday, March 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2015 at the University of Guelph.
        </p>
        <p>
          Roboticon is an annual event run in partnership with SOCIS and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.socs.uoguelph.ca/" >School of Computer Science</a>. It is an exciting opportunity for high school students to learn more about the field of Computer Science by designing and building <b>LEGO Mindstorms</b> robots to complete a series of challenges designed by our undergraduate students. Under strict rules and time limits, teams of students are challenged to build and program robots by sharpening teamwork skills and performing set tasks against a field of competitors. First Place winners receive a brand new LEGO Mindstorms EV3 ($450 value).
        </p>
        <p>
          This event is open to <b>all high school students!</b> Roboticon is a completely free event to attend, The School of Computer Science will loan and mail out LEGO Mindstorms EV3 kits to teams that register. All meals will be provided. Get a team and a teacher together to register your team! The School of Computer Science will loan and mail out LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Kits to teams that register.

        <h2>Event Format</h2>
        <hr>
        <ul>
          <li>Teams of up to four high-school students will build and program
          robots using LEGO Mindstorms kits to compete in two challenges</li>
          <li>The first challenge will be posted below, so students will have the
          opportunity to get a head start on designs</li>
          <li>Upon arrival, the students will have time to build and test their
          designs on our practice track</li>
          <li>There will be two heats for the first challenge, with build time in
          between for students to tweak and update their designs</li>
          <li>The second challenge will be presented at the end of the first day
          of competition, with two heats occurring on the second day</li>
          <li>Winners and prizes will be announced!</li>

        <h2>Challenge Description</h2>
        <hr>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The challenge area will be a 5 foot by 6 foot area enclosed by a 6 foot
            by 6 foot wall, characterised by a 5 by 6 grid of 1 foot by 1 foot squares
            of varying colour.
          </li>
          <li>
            Robots must navigate up one of the five columns (starting on a neutral tile)
            while reading a binary number from the grid beneath themselves, with digits being
            represented by white for 0 and grey for 1.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the robot reaches the end of column, it will need to turn. If the number read
            is divisible by either 3 or 4, the robot will turn left and travel down the next column to
            its left; otherwise, the robot will turn right and travel down the next column to its right.
          </li>
          <li>
            Robots must only travel each single column one time. If the next column it has been instructed
            to travel down has been traversed already, the robot must successfully continue traveling
            left/right until it reaches a column it has not yet traveled down.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the robot has traveled down all five columns, it must come to a complete stop in a neutral area.
          </li>
          <li>
            The robot will always start in the centre column facing in a predetermined direction.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scores will be tallied based on the number of columns successfully traveled in the correct
            direction and correct order. Ties will be decided by time taken.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <hr>
        <img src="/img/roboticon2015_grid.png" href="Guelph Roboticon Example Grid" class="dynamic-img" />
        <p class="text-center">Sample competition grid.</p>
        <hr class="grey">
        <p>
          The grid squares in the challenge area will be one of three colours: white, grey, and black.
          In the play area there will be three parts. See diagram.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Run-off: 6 inch wide run-off on either side of the main area.</li>
          <li>
            Neutral area: A row where squares will alternate in colour so as to make counting columns
            straightforward. There is one at both the top and bottom of a column, framing the active area.
            Note that the order in which colours alternate is not fixed, nor is any given neutral area
            guaranteed to use all three colours. The neutral area may not appear as it does in the diagram.
          </li>
          <li>
            Active area: Four squares framed by the neutral area which represent a 4-bit binary number.
            Digits in this number will be represented by white for 0 and grey for 1. The number is to be
            read first digit first; that is, the first digit read from the play area is the first digit in the
            binary number.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          So, from the example diagram, if we read from bottom to top: Column 1 is 1001, Column 2 is 1110,
          Column 3 is 0101, Column 4 is 1110, and Column 5 is 1011.
        </p>

          Challenge details are subject to minor change as ambiguities are eliminated and any concerns raised.
