      <h2>Challenge 1</h2>
      <p class="lead">You are an aspiring Pok&eacute;mon Master. In your quest
      to prove your worth of the title you venture in the search of rare
      Pok&eacute;mon. Part of this venture brings you upon Route 12, south of
      Lavender Town. It is rumoured by those that frequent this road that a
      Snorlax takes residence in these parts. You intend on finding and
      catching this Snorlax. This Pok&eacute;mon is very adept at being lazy,
      and has natural skill at hiding so as not to be disturbed when sleeping.
      This makes finding it no small task. You rationalise that you will be
      able to pinpoint its hiding place by following the sounds of its snores.
      Getting too close though is perilous, as waking a Snorlax is a sure way
      to find yourself blacking out.</p>
      <p>Unluckily, you have far to go in your strive for personal betterment.
      You've woken up late, and missed your opportunity to get a Pok&eacute;mon
      from Professor Oak. In petty sympathy of your blatant failure, Oak gives
      you a Master Ball as a token of good faith. As such, it is imperative you
      avoid the tall grass in the area, as your distinct lack of Pok&eacute;mon
      puts you at a disadvantage if you encounter anything. Going through, you
      will make an attempt to identify and avoid any tall grass you may come
      across.</p>

      <h3>Setup</h3>
      <p>Board: Rectangular 6 feet x 6 feet board, with 36 tiles (1 foot x 1
      foot coloured black, white, or gray) arranged in 6x6 format. There will
      be an 3.5-inch high wall around the grid.</p>
      <p>Robot: The robot must be less than 1 foot x 1 foot x 1 foot at all
      times and must remain in one piece. The robot may use only standard
      pieces from the kit.</p>

      <h3>Challenge</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>You will have to navigate the playing field to determine the
        location of the Snorlax. Using light&sol;colour and touch sensors to
        determine the state of the tile.</li>
        <li>Tiles adjacent to the Snorlax, in which you can hear its snoring,
        will be coloured a solid black. Tiles adjacent to tall grass, where you
        can see tall grass, will be coloured a solid gray, tall grass will have
        pins which can be knocked over and obstruct movement. Neutral tiles
        will be white.</li>
        <li>Snorlax will be lying on a small mountain (a plastic cup) on a gray
        or white tile.</li>
        <li>No tall grass will be diagonal to Snorlax, but they may be beside
        Snorlax.</li>
        <li>Entering tall grass (as decided by the judges) will give a 30
        second time penalty.</li>
        <li>Judges will place the robot on a specific, yet unknown, tile within
        the grid in a cardinal direction decided by the team.</li>
        <li>A team's run ends when either they have thrown their Masterball or
        they call their run by using a buzzer. Teams will be ranked first by if
        they caught Snorlax (throw the ball in a 90 degree arc in Snorlax's
        direction from the tile beside him) or not, and then by their run-time
        (lowest time is first, highest time is last).</li>
        <li>You will only have one Masterball to throw.</li>
        <li>There will be two heats with one attempt each.</li>
        <li>If a heat reaches 3 minutes it will be ended by the judges and
        scored as if called.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Rules</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Teams will only use parts from their kit.</li>
        <li>Teams can only use 1 touch, 1 ultrasonic, and 1 light/colour
        sensor.</li>
        <li>Teams<strong>MUST</strong> have their Bluetooth turned off on their
        brick.</li>
        <li>Robots must be smaller than 1 foot x 1 foot x 1 foot at all
        times.</li>
        <li>Teams will designate one person for ending their runs and deciding
        which direction to have the robot face, and only that person may call
        the run.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Challenge 2</h2>
      <p class="lead">Your epic quest is complete! After catching that Snorlax
      early in your career, you were able to easily blaze a path through the
      Pokemon world. Beating gym after gym, and trainer after trainer, and even
      the Elite Four. You have reached the top. Content with your achievements,
      you sit waiting for your position to be challenged by the next ambitious
      trainer.</p>
      <p>While admiring your vast collection of gym badges, you happen across
      your first 8 gym badges. From long ago, about 40 game hours, these badges
      mark the start of your successes.</p>
      <p>Sadly though, they have been unkempt for much of your journey to the
      top. As such, they are desperately dirty. Such items of sentimental
      meaning cannot be kept in such a state, so you set out to polish and tidy
      them up.</p>

      <h3>Setup</h3>
      <p>Board: Rectangular 6 feet x 6 feet board. There will be an 3.5-inch
      high wall around the grid.</p>
      <p>Robot: The robot must be less than 1 foot x 1 foot x 1 foot at all
      times and must remain in one piece. The robot may use only standard
      pieces from the kit.</p>

      <h3>Challenge</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>You will have to navigate the playing field to find and clear off
        the gym badges.</li>
        <li>Badges will be solid black and of various shapes and sizes (larger
        than 4-inches x 4-inches, and smaller than 10-inches x 10-inches). They
        will reside upon a white field 6-feet x 6-feet.</li>
        <li>Each of the 8 badges will have 1 to 3 specs of dust on them (1-inch
        diameter styrofoam balls).</li>
        <li>Judges will place the robot on a specific, yet unknown, white area
        of the field before they start the run. The judges will face the robot
        in a predetermined direction.</li>
        <li>A teams end will run when they call it, or when time runs out (2
        minutes). Teams will be scored by the number of “dust particals”
        (balls) still on the badges at the end of their run, and in the case of
        ties by time. The team with the cleanest badges (fewest balls on the
        badges) will be the first placed team and the one with the dirtiest
        (most balls on the badges) will be last.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Rules</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Teams will only use parts from their kit.</li>
        <li>Teams can only use touch and light sensors.</li>
        <li>Teams MUST have their Blue-Tooth turned off on their brick.</li>
        <li>Robots must be smaller than 1 foot x 1 foot x 1 foot.</li>
        <li>Teams will designate one person for ending their runs.</li>
      </ol>
