	<h2 class="indent">Challenge 1</h2>
	<p class="lead">
    You are an aspiring Pokémon Master. In your quest to prove your worth of the title you venture in the search of rare Pokémon. Part of this venture brings you upon Route 12, south of Lavender Town. It is rumoured by those that frequent this road that a Snorlax takes residence in these parts. You intend on finding and catching this Snorlax. This Pokémon is very adept at being lazy, and has natural skill at hiding so as not to be disturbed when sleeping. This makes finding it no small task. You rationalise that you will be able to pinpoint its hiding place by following the sounds of its snores. Getting too close though is perilous, as waking a Snorlax is a sure way to find yourself blacking out.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unluckily, you have far to go in your strive for personal betterment. You&#8217;ve woken up late, and missed your opportunity to get a Pokémon from Professor Oak. In petty sympathy of your blatant failure, Oak gives you a Master Ball as a token of good faith. As such, it is imperative you avoid the tall grass in the area, as your distinct lack of Pokémon puts you at a disadvantage if you encounter anything. Going through, you will make an attempt to identify and avoid any tall grass you may come across.
  </p>
  <h3>Setup</h3>
  <p>
    Board: Rectangular 6 feet x 6 feet board, with 36 tiles (1 foot x 1 foot coloured black, white, or gray) arranged in 6x6 format. There will be an 3.5-inch high wall around the grid.
  </p>
  <p>
    Robot: The robot must be less than 1 foot x 1 foot x 1 foot at all times and must remain in one piece. The robot may use only standard pieces from the kit.
  </p>
  <h3>Challenge</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>You will have to navigate the playing field to determine the location of the Snorlax. Using light/colour and touch sensors to determine the state of the tile.</li>
    <li>Tiles adjacent to the Snorlax, in which you can hear its snoring, will be coloured a solid black. Tiles adjacent to tall grass, where you can see tall grass, will be coloured a solid gray, tall grass will have pins which can be knocked over and obstruct movement. Neutral tiles will be white.</li>
    <li>Snorlax will be lying on a small mountain (a plastic cup) on a gray or white tile.</li>
    <li>No tall grass will be diagonal to Snorlax, but they may be beside Snorlax.</li>
    <li>Entering tall grass (as decided by the judges) will give a 30 second time penalty.</li>
    <li>Judges will place the robot on a specific, yet unknown, tile within the grid in a cardinal direction decided by the team.</li>
    <li>A team&#8217;s run ends when either they have thrown their Masterball or they call their run by using a buzzer. Teams will be ranked first by if they caught Snorlax (throw the ball in a 90 degree arc in Snorlax&#8217;s direction from the tile beside him) or not, and then by their run-time (lowest time is first, highest time is last).</li>
    <li>You will only have one Masterball to throw.</li>
    <li>There will be two heats with one attempt each.</li>
    <li>If a heat reaches 3 minutes it will be ended by the judges and scored as if called.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Rules</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Teams will only use parts from their kit.</li>
    <li>Teams can only use 1 touch, 1 ultrasonic, and 1 light/colour sensor.</li>
    <li>Teams <strong>MUST</strong> have their Bluetooth turned off on their brick.</li>
    <li>Robots must be smaller than 1 foot x 1 foot x 1 foot at all times.</li>
    <li>Teams will designate one person for ending their runs and deciding which direction to have the robot face, and only that person may call the run.</li>
  </ol>
