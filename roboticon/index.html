        <p>
          Roboticon is back for 2017 at College Royal at the University of Guelph! The University of Guelph would like to invite you to Roboticon 2017. This year's robot-building and programming challenge will be occurring on <b>Saturday, March 18<sup>th</sup> &amp; Sunday, March 19<sup>th</sup>, 2017 at the University of Guelph</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Roboticon is an annual event run in partnership with SOCIS and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.socs.uoguelph.ca/" >School of Computer Science</a>. It is an exciting opportunity for high school students to learn more about the field of Computer Science by designing and building <b>LEGO Mindstorms</b> robots to complete a series of challenges designed by our undergraduate students. Under strict rules and time limits, teams of students are challenged to build and program robots by sharpening teamwork skills and performing set tasks against a field of competitors.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Our First Place winners will receive a brand new LEGO Mindstorms EV3 kit and we will be giving away Second and Third Place LEGO gift card prizes! There will also be raffle prizes.
        </p>
        <p>
          This event is open to <b>all high school students!</b> Roboticon is a completely free event to attend. The School of Computer Science will loan and mail out LEGO Mindstorms EV3 kits to teams that register on a first come, first serve basis. All meals will be provided. Get a team and a teacher together to register your team!
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Teams of up to four high-school students will build and program
          robots using LEGO Mindstorms kits to compete in two challenges</li>

          <li>Upon arrival, the students will have time to build and test their
          designs on our practice track</li>
          <li>There will be two heats for the first challenge, with build time in
          between for students to tweak and update their designs</li>

        <h2>Challenge One Description</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            This year's theme is Nintendo!
        </p>
        <p>"You are Link, the Hero of Hyrule, and you are attempting to complete the latest challenge in the latest dungeon in your latest quest to save Hyrule… again! This task demands you move a box! This box must be placed on a button to open the gate and continue, but between the you and the goal is a perilously narrow bridge, with a bottomless chasm of death and despair featured on both sides! Try not to let the box fall over the edge. Time get that box moving, and save Hyrule… again!"</p>
        <hr>
        <ol>
          <li>The challenge area will be 6 feet wide by 6 feet long, enclosed by a 3.5 inch wall on all four sides.</li>
          <li>Participants’ robots will have to move a 3 inch styrofoam cube from a start area to an end area.</li>
          <li>In between these two areas will be a path, and the cube must remain completely inside this path while being moved. The robot can move in and out of the path at will without penalty. </li>
          <li>The start and end areas will each be grey 8 inch squares, and the path will be an 8 inch wide black strip connecting the two.</li>
          <li>The positions and rotation of the start and end points is indeterminate, and the path may move around the play area randomly, but will never cross itself.</li>
          <li>The cube must be in full contact with the ground at all times when being moved. This is to eliminate any ambiguity as to if the cube in the path or not.</li>
          <li>Points will be given as such:
             <ol type="a">
                <li>1 point for the cube “reaching” the end area, and 1 point each for passing the 3 checkpoints in the path, for a maximum of 4 points.</li>
                <li>The cube will only only be considered to have “reached” the end only if it’s entirely within the grey end area.</li>
                <li>The highest number of points achieved will be awarded, so if the cube succeeds in “reaching” the end area, but exits the it before you can call your run, you will still be awarded the point. </li>
                <li>Checkpoints will be placed at ⅓  and ⅔ through the path, and immediately before the end area. </li>
                <li>Credit for passing a checkpoint will only be given if the cube did not leave the path area at any point of the of the ⅓ track leading up to that checkpoint.</li>
                <li>A checkpoint will be considered “passed” when any part of the cube crosses it, and can only be passed once.</li>
             </ol>
