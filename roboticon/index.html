    <p class="lead">Roboticon is back for the 13<sup>th</sup> year at College
    Royale 2014!</p>

    <p>Roboticon is an annual event run in partnership with SOCIS and
    the<a href="http://www.socs.uoguelph.ca/">School of Computer Science</a>.
    It is an exciting opportunity for high school students to learn more
    about the field of Computer Science by designing and building<a href=
      "http://mindstorms.lego.com/en-us/default.aspx">Lego Mindstorms</a>
    robots to complete a series of challenges designed by SOCIS students.</p>

    <p><strong>This event is open to all high school students!</strong> Get a
    team of four and a teacher together to register your team! The School of
    Computer Science will loan Lego Mindstorm NXT Kits to teams that
    register.</p>

    <p><strong>Roboticon is a completely free event to attend, we even
      provide meals!</strong> Register for this event for your chance to win a
    number of great prizes. First Place receives a brand new Mindstorms
    Kit!</p>

    <h2 class="indent">Event Format</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Teams of up to four high-school students will build and program
      robots using LEGO Mindstorms kits to compete in two challenges</li>

      <li>The first challenge will be posted below, so students will have the
      opportunity to get a head start on designs</li>

      <li>Upon arrival, the students will have time to build and test their
      designs on our practice track</li>

      <li>There will be two heats for the first challenge, with build time in
      between for students to tweak and update their designs</li>

      <li>The second challenge will be presented at the end of the first day
      of competition, with two heats occurring on the second day</li>

      <li>Winners and prizes will be announced!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="indent">Challenge 1</h2>

    <p class="lead">You are an aspiring Pok&eacute;mon Master. In your quest
    to prove your worth of the title you venture in the search of rare
    Pok&eacute;mon. Part of this venture brings you upon Route 12, south of
    Lavender Town. It is rumoured by those that frequent this road that a
    Snorlax takes residence in these parts. You intend on finding and
    catching this Snorlax. This Pok&eacute;mon is very adept at being lazy,
    and has natural skill at hiding so as not to be disturbed when sleeping.
    This makes finding it no small task. You rationalise that you will be
    able to pinpoint its hiding place by following the sounds of its snores.
    Getting too close though is perilous, as waking a Snorlax is a sure way
    to find yourself blacking out.</p>

    <p>Unluckily, you have far to go in your strive for personal betterment.
    You've woken up late, and missed your opportunity to get a Pok&eacute;mon
    from Professor Oak. In petty sympathy of your blatant failure, Oak gives
    you a Master Ball as a token of good faith. As such, it is imperative you
    avoid the tall grass in the area, as your distinct lack of Pok&eacute;mon
    puts you at a disadvantage if you encounter anything. Going through, you
    will make an attempt to identify and avoid any tall grass you may come
    across.</p>

    <h3>Setup</h3>

    <p>Board: Rectangular 6 feet x 6 feet board, with 36 tiles (1 foot x 1
    foot coloured black, white, or gray) arranged in 6x6 format. There will
    be an 3.5-inch high wall around the grid.</p>

    <p>Robot: The robot must be less than 1 foot x 1 foot x 1 foot at all
    times and must remain in one piece. The robot may use only standard
    pieces from the kit.</p>

    <h3>Challenge</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>You will have to navigate the playing field to determine the
      location of the Snorlax. Using light&sol;colour and touch sensors to
      determine the state of the tile.</li>

      <li>Tiles adjacent to the Snorlax, in which you can hear its snoring,
      will be coloured a solid black. Tiles adjacent to tall grass, where you
      can see tall grass, will be coloured a solid gray, tall grass will have
      pins which can be knocked over and obstruct movement. Neutral tiles
      will be white.</li>

      <li>Snorlax will be lying on a small mountain (a plastic cup) on a gray
      or white tile.</li>

      <li>No tall grass will be diagonal to Snorlax, but they may be beside
      Snorlax.</li>

      <li>Entering tall grass (as decided by the judges) will give a 30
      second time penalty.</li>

      <li>Judges will place the robot on a specific, yet unknown, tile within
      the grid in a cardinal direction decided by the team.</li>

      <li>A team's run ends when either they have thrown their Masterball or
      they call their run by using a buzzer. Teams will be ranked first by if
      they caught Snorlax (throw the ball in a 90 degree arc in Snorlax's
      direction from the tile beside him) or not, and then by their run-time
      (lowest time is first, highest time is last).</li>

      <li>You will only have one Masterball to throw.</li>

      <li>There will be two heats with one attempt each.</li>

      <li>If a heat reaches 3 minutes it will be ended by the judges and
      scored as if called.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Rules</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Teams will only use parts from their kit.</li>

      <li>Teams can only use 1 touch, 1 ultrasonic, and 1 light/colour
      sensor.</li>

      <li>Teams<strong>MUST</strong> have their Bluetooth turned off on their
      brick.</li>

      <li>Robots must be smaller than 1 foot x 1 foot x 1 foot at all
      times.</li>

      <li>Teams will designate one person for ending their runs and deciding
      which direction to have the robot face, and only that person may call
      the run.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="indent">Challenge 2</h2>

    <p class="lead">Your epic quest is complete! After catching that Snorlax
    early in your career, you were able to easily blaze a path through the
    Pokemon world. Beating gym after gym, and trainer after trainer, and even
    the Elite Four. You have reached the top. Content with your achievements,
    you sit waiting for your position to be challenged by the next ambitious
    trainer.</p>

    <p>While admiring your vast collection of gym badges, you happen across
    your first 8 gym badges. From long ago, about 40 game hours, these badges
    mark the start of your successes.</p>

    <p>Sadly though, they have been unkempt for much of your journey to the
    top. As such, they are desperately dirty. Such items of sentimental
    meaning cannot be kept in such a state, so you set out to polish and tidy
    them up.</p>

    <h3>Setup</h3>

    <p>Board: Rectangular 6 feet x 6 feet board. There will be an 3.5-inch
    high wall around the grid.</p>

    <p>Robot: The robot must be less than 1 foot x 1 foot x 1 foot at all
    times and must remain in one piece. The robot may use only standard
    pieces from the kit.</p>

    <h3>Challenge</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>You will have to navigate the playing field to find and clear off
      the gym badges.</li>

      <li>Badges will be solid black and of various shapes and sizes (larger
      than 4-inches x 4-inches, and smaller than 10-inches x 10-inches). They
      will reside upon a white field 6-feet x 6-feet.</li>

      <li>Each of the 8 badges will have 1 to 3 specs of dust on them (1-inch
      diameter styrofoam balls).</li>

      <li>Judges will place the robot on a specific, yet unknown, white area
      of the field before they start the run. The judges will face the robot
      in a predetermined direction.</li>

      <li>A teams end will run when they call it, or when time runs out (2
      minutes). Teams will be scored by the number of “dust particals”
      (balls) still on the badges at the end of their run, and in the case of
      ties by time. The team with the cleanest badges (fewest balls on the
      badges) will be the first placed team and the one with the dirtiest
      (most balls on the badges) will be last.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Rules</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Teams will only use parts from their kit.</li>

      <li>Teams can only use touch and light sensors.</li>

      <li>Teams MUST have their Blue-Tooth turned off on their brick.</li>

      <li>Robots must be smaller than 1 foot x 1 foot x 1 foot.</li>

      <li>Teams will designate one person for ending their runs.</li>
    </ol>
