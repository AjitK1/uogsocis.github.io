        <p>
          Roboticon is back for 2017 at College Royal at the University of Guelph! The University of Guelph would like to invite you to Roboticon 2017. This year's robot-building and programming challenge will be occurring on <b>Saturday, March 18<sup>th</sup> &amp; Sunday, March 19<sup>th</sup>, 2017 at the University of Guelph</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Roboticon is an annual event run in partnership with SOCIS and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.socs.uoguelph.ca/" >School of Computer Science</a>. It is an exciting opportunity for high school students to learn more about the field of Computer Science by designing and building <b>LEGO Mindstorms</b> robots to complete a series of challenges designed by our undergraduate students. Under strict rules and time limits, teams of students are challenged to build and program robots by sharpening teamwork skills and performing set tasks against a field of competitors.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Our First Place winners will receive a brand new LEGO Mindstorms EV3 kit and we will be giving away Second and Third Place LEGO gift card prizes! There will also be giving away raffle prizes.
        </p>
        <p>
          This event is open to <b>all high school students!</b> Roboticon is a completely free event to attend, The School of Computer Science will loan and mail out LEGO Mindstorms EV3 kits to teams that register. All meals will be provided. Get a team and a teacher together to register your team!
        </p>

        <h2>Event Format</h2>
        <hr>
        <ul>
          <li>Teams of up to four high-school students will build and program
          robots using LEGO Mindstorms kits to compete in two challenges</li>
          <li>The first challenge will be posted below, so students will have the
          opportunity to get a head start on designs</li>
          <li>Upon arrival, the students will have time to build and test their
          designs on our practice track</li>
          <li>There will be two heats for the first challenge, with build time in
          between for students to tweak and update their designs</li>
          <li>The second challenge will be presented at the end of the first day
          of competition, with two heats occurring on the second day</li>
          <li>Winners and prizes will be announced!</li>

        <h2>Challenge Two Description</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            This year's theme is Nintendo!
        </p>
        <p>" “Mama Mia! This is a really scary,” Luigi thinks to himself as he steps through yet another door in this haunted mansion. The door closes behind him and before him is a pitch black room, the only light coming from a small floating ball just ahead. It moves curiously, almost as if it’s beckoning to him to follow it. He steps forward and the ball of light moves forward as well. This ball of light obvious intends to lead Luigi through the room, so he resolves to trust it. Best not stray to far from the path it leads, who knows what could be lurking in the dark? "</p>
        <hr>
        <ol>
          <li>The challenge area will be 6 feet wide by 6 feet long, enclosed by a 3.5 inch wall on all four sides.</li>
          <li>Similar to challenge 1, contestant’s robots will have to follow a path that will follow an indeterminate path from point A to point B. This path will be 3 inches wide and will be pure black. </li>
          <li>Contestant’s robots will start centred on the path, with the rear of the robot flush will the start of the path. </li>
          <li>On either side of the path will be plastic miniature bowling pins, placed 6 inches from the edge of the path.</li>
          <li>The goal is to travel the path without knocking down any of the pins. The path will guide your robot safely through the pins.</li>
          <li>Also similar to challenge 1, the path will be split into thirds, each ending with a checkpoint.</li>
          <li>Crossing each checkpoint successfully will yield 3 points, for a possible total of 9.  A checkpoint will have been “crossed” if any part of the robot crosses it in the correct direction of travel, and did so within the pins. A robot is “within” the pins if no part of it is past 6 inches away from the track.</li>
          <li>There will be 3 pins adjacent each third, for a total of 9 pins. Their placement along the path will be indeterminate, but will be staggered and reasonably spaced (see example image for what we mean.)</li>
          <li>Knocking over pins will result in a deduction of 1 point per pin. Scores will be tallied only after a run is called and cannot go below 0.</li>
          <li>To clearly delimit each 3rd of the track, grey strips will be placed on either side of the track to mark the checkpoints between thirds. The same shade of grey will be used for markings indicating where we’ll be placing pins, so pin placement can be consistent for all contestants. These are purely for human reference and can be ignored by the robot.</li>
