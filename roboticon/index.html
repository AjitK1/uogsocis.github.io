          Roboticon is back for 2016 at College Royal at the University of Guelph! The University of Guelph would like to invite you to Roboticon 2016. This year's robot-building and programming challenge will be occurring on <b>Saturday, March 19<sup>th</sup> &amp; Sunday, March 20<sup>th</sup>, 2016 at the University of Guelph</b>.

It is an exciting opportunity for high school students to learn more about the field of Computer Science by designing and building <b>LEGO Mindstorms</b> robots to complete a series of challenges designed by our undergraduate students. Under strict rules and time limits, teams of students are challenged to build and program robots by sharpening teamwork skills and performing set tasks against a field of competitors.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Our First Place winners will receive a brand new LEGO Mindstorms EV3 kit and we will be giving away Second and Third Place LEGO gift card prizes! New this year, we will also be giving away raffle prizes.

        <h2>Challenge Two Description</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>"Your brave ally has dove into the trench to make the run to destroy the Death Star. While they make their way to the exhaust port, it is imperative you and the rest of your squadron keep the Empire’s TIE Fighters off their backs. The battle is incredibly chaotic, making it very difficult to distinguish friend from foe. Destroy as many TIE Fighters as possible, but avoid friendly fire at all costs!"</p>
        <hr>
        <ol>
          <li>The challenge area will be 6 feet wide by 6 feet long, with a wall on all four sides.</li>
          <li>The robot will begin in a set position, facing a direction of the competitors’ choosing.The starting position is indeterminate, but will be the same for all competitors.</li>
          <li>There will again be a series of 10 circles distributed randomly around the play area.</li>
          <li>There are two types of circles, black circles and grey circles, five of each. All ten are 1 foot in diameter, and will have one of the same dowels as used in challenge 1 in the centre of each.</li>
          <li>Black circles will represent TIE Fighters, and grey circles will represent friendly X-Wings.</li>
          <li>Your robot is tasked with knocking over as many of the dowels in the centre of black circles, while simultaneously avoiding knocking over the dowels in the centre of grey circles.</li>
          <li>Scoring will be completed at the end of each run as such: Dowels in the centre of black circles (black dowels) will be worth 30 points each if knocked over. Dowels in the centre of grey circles (grey dowels) will be worth 5 points each if knocked over. For each grey dowel that is knocked over though, the number of points each black dowel is worth will be lowered by 6 points, to a minimum of 0 per black dowel. Maximum possible score is 150, minimum is 0, with 25 being the score of a team that knocks over all 5 grey dowels.</li>
          <li>Teams will be ranked by total points and ties will be decided by time taken. </li>
        </ol>
