		We are the Society of Computing and Information Science.
	</p>
	We are a group of Computer Science students dedicated to bettering the CS community at the University of Guelph. We work closely with the <a href="http://www.socs.uoguelph.ca/">School of Computer Science</a> in planning the future of the School of Computer Science with our focus on benefitting students. We also run community building events and manage the CS Lounge in Reynolds 102.

		Our Role in the School of Computer Science
	</h2>
	<p class="lead">
		Computer Science students have a voice inside the department and that voice is SOCIS.
	</p>
	At least one of our executives is at every department meeting giving input on the topics discussed at the meeting. This has far reaching affects on topics like the future curriculum provided to CS and S. ENG majors. We also help the department to run events like the annual SOCS barbeque held every year in September to help welcome first year CS students to the University.

		Events
	</h2>
	<p class="lead">We run events to bring CS students closer together.</p>
	Every year SOCIS runs a number of events like Hackathons, LANs and movie nights that help to bring CS students closer together and build community in our small but growing College. You can keep up to date on these events through this site, our Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/UoGSOCIS/">group</a>, or our email <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1O3K63UpMSTVm5h1UzydnRTddowNPeq0glZ3wkLazpL8/viewform">newsletter</a>.
	<br>
	We also send team(s) to <a href="http://csgames.org/">CS Games</a> every year to compete against other schools. And we help to sponsor a trip to <a href="http://cusec.net/">CUSEC</a> for any students that want to go. Finally every year SOCIS students are the driving force behind one of the largest <a href="www.collegeroyalsociety.com">College Royale</a> events, <a href="{{ root_url }}/roboticon/">Roboticon</a>
