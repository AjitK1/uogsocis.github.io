          We are a group of computer science students for computer science students. We coordinate with the <a href="http://www.socs.uoguelph.ca/">School of Computer Science</a> in planning the future of Computer Science at Guelph. We also manage a number of services for students like the CS lounge which is a space for relaxation and socializing.

          <p>
          We run events throughout the year to build the community in the Computer Science department at Guelph. In the past we have run Hackathons, LANs and Paintballing. We are always looking for new events to run so if you have any thing you'd like to see us do let us know!

          <p>
          Roboticon is an anual effort by the School of Computer Science and SOCIS to foster high schoolers' interest in the field of Computer Science. Competitors are tasked with building <a href="http://mindstorms.lego.com/en-us/default.aspx">Lego Mindstorms</a> robots to complete a series of challenges designed by SOCIS members.
